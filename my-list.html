					<h2>What is E-sports?</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Esports, short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games. Esports often takes
					the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional
					players, individually or as teams. Although organized competitions have long been a part of video
					game culture, these were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when participation by
					professional gamers and spectatorship in these events through live streaming saw a large surge in
					popularity. By the 2010s, esports was a significant factor in the video game industry, with many
					game developers actively designing and providing funding for tournaments and other events.</p>
